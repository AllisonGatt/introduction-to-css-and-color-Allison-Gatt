    <h2>Allison Gatt </h2>
    <p>My name is Allison Gatt and I am a senior at Madonna majoring in Biology
      and double minoring in Chemistry and Computer Science. I hope to graduate May 2025. </p>

      One of my favorite hobbies is paddle boarding, and there are several reasons why I enjoy it so much. 
      First, it allows me to fully immerse myself in the outdoors, offering a sense of adventure and excitement 
      as I explore. While I love being near the water, I do not always love to be actively swimming, which makes 
      paddle boarding perfect since I can enjoy the water without having to be in it the entire time. 
      Plus, it is a fantastic way to stay active and get a great workout.</p>
